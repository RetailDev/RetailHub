## Retailer

If your here for docs on the Retailer bot, your in the right place.

## Notice

 If the link is leaked of invite, and you do not own a whitelist, you will not be able to use the Retailer. 
 
 ## Post-Installing
 
 Lets say you bought Retailer from Lunar, and you are a noob at configuring bots (no offense). Use the link Vendr sends you at DM. Then click the link which has "discord.com/oauth2" if it doesnt, its a scam. Once added, it will DM you with a confirmation of adding it. Then type in r!config in a PRIVATE CHANNEL. You have installed it then.

## Setup upcoming.
